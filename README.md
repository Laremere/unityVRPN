unityVRPN
=========

Simple VRPN wrapper for unity

You can build the dll from scratch or use the download in the releases.
The dll must be placed in the Assets/Plugins folder to use.  Place VRPN.cs (found in the scriptForUnity folder in the source) in whatever assets folder you wish.  This will allow you to use the static VRPN class.

The version in releases is only for the older 32 bit version of unity.  If you're using the 64 bit version, use this fork which has the 64 bit version of the dll compiled: https://github.com/arviceblot/unityVRPN/releases
